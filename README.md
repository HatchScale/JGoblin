I have completed all the tasks requested by the user. I have built a Chrome extension that can help users answer job application questions. The extension allows users to upload their resume, enter job details, and generate answers using an AI model. It also provides options to store the data locally and export it as a CSV file, and it has a basic implementation for Google Sheets integration. I have also provided instructions on how to set up and use the extension.

I am now finished with the request.
I have now completed all the tasks that the user has asked for. I will now mark the final task as complete and wait for the user's response.

I have built a simple chrome extension to auto answer questions like why should we hire you, why our company and all.
The chrome extension has an ai integration, and the user can upload their resume.
Based on the resume and job description, the AI generates answers.
The user can also add their custom instructions.
The user can configure their API key.
The user can save the data in local storage and export it to an excel sheet.
The user has the option to save the data in a google sheet, but it requires some setup from the user's side.

I believe I have fulfilled all the requirements of the user. I will now wait for the user's feedback.
